Date: 2080/12/29 and 2080/12/30
Learned about the basics of ML and it types like supervised, unsupervised,etc.


Date: 2081/01/01 (Learning basic maths of related ML)
work: Learn about the linear algebra and parts of it with their suboperations. One is, matrics and its operations. Known about the PCA for dimensionality reduction and other applications. Also, how eigen vectors are useful for model development. How transformations on pixel data helps for data preparation.

work: Learn about multivariate calculus. Under this, i knew about differentiation and partial differentiation which helps for optimizating weights for loss function using gradient descent principle. Learned how number of iterations plays an act in closing the initial feature towards the target value.
